Administration Menu Dropdown
------------------------
By: Shawn Conn (http://www.shawnconn.com/contact)

This module modifies the awesome Drupal Administration Menu module
(http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu). Combined with a little Javascript and 
CSS, the menu can be shown or hidden by pressing a key combo 
(Ctrl+Altby default). Pressing another combo (Ctrl+Shift+Alt by default) will 
disable this functionality if it is needed. If you find a certain key combo 
conflicts with your browser or OS, you can change the combo in Administration 
menu dropdown settings.

To install, place the Administration Menu Dropdown folder into your modules 
directory. Make sure that Administration Menu is enabled. 
Go to administer -> site building -> modules to enable the module. After the 
module has been enabled the Administration Menu should be hidden by default. 
The default state as well as the combo keys can be changed by going to 
admin/settings/admin_menu_dropdown.

Thanks to Deciphered for the key combo switching patch
