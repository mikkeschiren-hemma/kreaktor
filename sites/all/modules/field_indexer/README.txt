README file for the Field Indexer module.


Description
***********

The Field Indexer module indexes field data into Drupal's search index. Each
field enabled for indexing becomes a type of index entry. Then, with an
appropriate search module, users may perform keyword searches restricted by
field.


Search modules
**************

The following modules implement field search based on index data generated by
Field Indexer:

- Faceted Search (http://drupal.org/project/faceted_search); this support is
  experimental, only in the dev version at this point.

One could imagine similar support being added to Views, for example, although no
one have stepped up.

The package
***********

Field Indexer is in fact a bundle of modules:

- Field Indexer: Provides a configuration page where the site administrator may
  select which fields to index. This module also provides a basic API for field
  indexing modules.

- Node Field Indexer: Implements indexing for core node data (only the node
  title is supported at the moment).

- CCK Field Indexer: Implements indexing for CCK [3] fields.

Third-party modules may implement support for additional types of fields.
