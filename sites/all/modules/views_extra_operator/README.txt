Informations:
-------------
This is my first Views module, I'm just pretty new in Views module hacking !
This is a very simple module who add new operators to view's arguments.
It can be very useful.
Currently, only text fields are working.
I'm planning to add numeric fields and date fields.
I tried to add numeric fields support but did not succeeded, any help is welcome !
