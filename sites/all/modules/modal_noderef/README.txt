Brief description:

This module is designed to take CCK nodereference autocomplete fields and make 
it possible to create new nodes in a modal popup, and then automatically add
the new node(s) as nodereferences.

To use this module:

Install it using the usual method(s).

You will now have an additional checkbox on your CCK field pages for node references.
This checkbox is labeled 'Show modal editor'. IF YOU CHECK THIS, then you will get
the modal nodereference editor link beneath your CCK node reference autocomplate
fields.
